You will need : dh-make, fakeroot

Then : 

dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

To clean :

fakeroot debian/rules clean

This is package with make debian.

Things to know :
 - On some systems, strip don't work : use DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=--nostrip
 - You must make clean before, or ./configure
   --prefix=/path/to/the/debian/rphoto
 - To quick build : fakeroot debian/rules binary
